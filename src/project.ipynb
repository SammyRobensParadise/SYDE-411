    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem will be formulated as follows: Given 1 bus with a maximum capacity, $m$, we want to minimize the distance that the bus has to travel to $n$ locations (nodes) to pick up a total number of $P$ people where there are $p$ individual people located at each n location and drive the people to a central location c. Given the constraint of the bus size, this means that if $P \\gt m$ the bus will need to pass through the central location $c$ more than 2 times (once leaving and once arriving) to go back out and collect the remaining people. Our objective function is to minimize the total distance travelled, which is in turn a function of the distance to each location, and the number of people at each location. It is constrained by the maximum bus capacity, $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has applications in shuttle bus schedules, especially in the tourist industry where it is often required to bring people from a number of different locations back to one central location (such as an event).\n"

    "## Seeding Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is create a function that will _seed_ test data so that we can have sudo-random data generated while also having repeatable and verifiable results. We are going to do this by creating a $n\\times n\\times p$ matrix where $n$ is the number of _nodes_ that are present in the data model. This means that for every node, we are also calculating the distance to each other node when we create our test data.\n",

    "### Assumptions in The Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We are assuming that all distances are in meters. We will assume that all of our locations exist within a $1000 \\times 1000$-meter grid where each location is a distance of at least 1 meter away from another location, and no two locations have the same coordinate.\n"
