## Project Guidelines

**SYDE 411 Optimization and Numerical Methods**

_Project Guidelines_

This group project involves searching for a real-world engineering optimization problem by you,
which is formulated mathematically, then solved and analyzed by applying a suitable optimization
technique, which is implemented in MATLAB or Python. As described below, a presentation is
required, in addition to submitting a final report and related MATLAB or Python code.

**Important Notes:**

1. The optimization problem you choose should be multivariable with some constraints such that
   applying optimization techniques is needed to solve it, and finding a solution without computer
   programming/software tools is very hard. A one-page proposal focusing on a general description
   of the considered problem should be submitted through a Dropbox folder on LEARN by Friday,
   Oct. 21.
2. A proper set of design variables should be selected, and the objective function and constraints
   should be formulated accordingly in a mathematical programming form. The problem will then be
   solved by implementing a proper optimization algorithm, or using an optimization toolbox, in
   MATLAB or Python (using another software package or computer programming is possible by
   permission). Finally, the results should be analyzed by considering the nature of the solution (local
   or global optimum), selected optimization technique performance (convergence, computational
   speed, etc.), characteristics of the problem like its feasible region, unimodality, convexity,
   continuity, and so on.
   Deliverables:
3. A Powerpoint presentation with three main slides on: i) problem description, ii) formulation and
   optimization method, and iii) some results/analyses. The presentation time will be: “5 minutes
   for the slides” plus “3 minutes for Q&A” (totally, 8 minutes). More information about the
   presentations (dates, order, etc.) will be given later.
4. A technical report (main body less than ten pages, having an appendix is acceptable), including
   the problem description, modeling & formulation, assumptions, choice of applied optimization
   technique, results, analyses, conclusions, and suggestions for future steps. A soft copy of the report
   and MATLAB or Python files should be submitted through a Dropbox folder on LEARN. The
   project report/files should be submitted by Tuesday, Dec. 6.

**Evaluation:**

Please note that the following factors will be taken into account for marking the project report:

- Proper background, motivation, and context for the selected optimization problem.
- Clarity and validity of the problem description, formulation, constraints, objective function,
  feasible region, etc.
- Using a suitable method (and the related logic) to solve the problem, properly implementing the
  technique for the given problem formulation and a clear explanation or flowchart for this process.
- Clarity, validity, and justification of solutions/results.
- Mindful discussions of convergence and computational efficiency of the optimization method,
  discussing the nature of solution (global or local) and related justifications, convexity,
  unimodality/multimodality of the objective function, constraint satisfactions, the effects of initial
  guess (when a numerical method is used), any other thoughtful explanations from an optimization
  perspective.
- Level of complexity of the considered problem, including the number of constraints and
  optimization variables, objective function form, discontinuity, multimodality, etc.
- Any innovation in the optimization formulation or methodology to solve the selected
  optimization problem. Using optimization techniques that are not covered in the course is possible
  through permission/consultation with the instructor.
- Report format/structure, figure qualities, grammar, conclusions & suggestions for future steps,
  etc.
  Please note this is a group project and requires the participation of all group members for the entire
  tasks. If you need further information, please don’t hesitate to contact the instructor. Enjoy your
  project!
